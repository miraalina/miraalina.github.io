        <h1 style="color:orange"> Hi, my name is Mira :-)</h1>
        <p> I'm an Erasmus student from Cologne, Germany, where I study Integrated Design. </p>
        <p> I already had a seminar about html and css where I had to design a simple website.
            But honestly I can't remember that much.
